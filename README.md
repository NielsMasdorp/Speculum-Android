This is an Android application for a magic mirror
I had an old Nexus 7 (2012) lying around collecting dust and got the idea from [HomeMirror by Hannah Mitt](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror)

However, I deciced to make my own. Feel free to make this code neat for your own device (it was designed for the Nexus 7). Have any great idea's? submit a pull request!
